					 <p>Maintaining an ideal body temperature is required when it comes to keeping patients warm during the surgery period. In order to provide the best service to patients, read out important things about patient warming systems. Wallabies Warm Care in Ontario, Canada is the leading supplier of these medical devices. </p>
<h1>Maintains body temperature</h1>
<p>The core human body temperature is close to 37 degrees Celsius. Hypothermia is referred to a body temperature that is below 36 degrees. The difference in body temperature is maintained through thermoregulation. Patient warmers work to maintain a core body temperature that prevents patients from hypothermic conditions. </p>

				<h1>Anesthesia affects body temperature</h1>
<p>Anesthesia is necessary for patients before the time of surgery. But, within the first hour of anesthesia, it can cause a significant drop in body temperature. Hence, the blood flowing in the body of patients becomes cool. The patient experience shivering that leads to anxious instances as well. Our patient warming systems work by maintaining a warm body temperature to reduce the adverse effect of anesthesia on the patient’s body. </p>
<h1>Operation rooms are colder</h1>
<p>Most operation rooms' temperatures are kept at 21 degrees Celsius. Therefore, patients feel cold in the environment which also makes them uncomfortable. Moreover, anesthesia makes them unable to move and the temperature of their bodies keeps decreasing. Persistent drops in temperature can increase the risk of blood loss and delay wound healing. Hence, the use of air-warming units is vital and is considered standard-of-care in hospitals. </p>
<h1>Being hypothermic is risky</h1>
<p>Hypothermia in patients is a common occurrence that is mostly inevitable before, during, and after surgery. However, the symptoms of hypothermia may vary from person to person. In some patients, it can significantly increase the risk of adverse health complications. This could include huge blood loss, infection of the surgical site, increase in pain, and even risk of cardiac disturbance. It also increases costs to the healthcare system with blood work, lengthy stays, and re-admission of patients. Therefore, by using warming blankets and heating units, hospitals can decrease the cost of operation too. </p>
<h1>Warming units are effective</h1>
<p>An effective warming system has the ability to provide as much as possible warmth to the patient skin. Wallabies Warm Care is able to provide a demonstration of its warming products with evidence of efficient working. The measure of our patient warming systems has unvarying temperature maintenance for patients. The units attached to blankets allow the warm air to flow consistently to provide ultimate heating to the maximum skin surface of patients.</p>
<h1>Patient warming is complicated</h1>
<p>Some patients are harder to warm when the patient’s body is actively exposed to a cold environment. Patients need to warm actively which might require multiple blankets and heating devices. Traditional blankets are not enough to provide heat to patients thus use of modern heating blankets is necessary. These blankets work with electrical units that provide continuous heating to patients. Medical guidelines recommended that patients must be kept warm before anesthesia. So, the use of these systems would keep the temperature warm when the warmed core blood flows into the body. </p>
