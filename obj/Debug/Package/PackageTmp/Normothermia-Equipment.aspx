						  <p>Every surgical procedure performed by doctors is intended to bring
healthy outcomes for patients admitted to the hospitals. However,
there could be several obstructions that may hamper the quality of
treatment. Hypothermia is the most common complication which is
related to the body temperature of the patients. It usually occurs
before and after the surgical procedure when patients remain under
influence of anesthesia. A drop in the patient’s body temperature
can make all the difference between the healthy and complicated
recovery of patients. Even mild hypothermia which is a body
temperature of less than 36 degree Celsius can cause
complications. Hence, the use of normothermia equipment is
preferred to prevent complications.</p>

				<h1>What is normothermia and why it is important?</h1>
<p> Well, normothermia is the condition of having a normal body
temperature. It is a term used to define the guidelines for the
prevention of unplanned decreases in the temperature of patients.
Normothermia is the core body temperature that ranges between 36
to 38 degree Celsius. It is the acceptable level of body warmth and
is required during the surgical period for patients. The anxiety of
the surgical procedure can play a major role in dropping the
temperature of the patient’s body. It can also be happened due to
anesthesia administered to the patient before surgical treatment.
The condition is known as hypothermia which can pose several
complications to patients.</p>
<h1>What does normothermia equipment do?</h1>
<p> It is needless to cite that a patient who requires a surgical
procedure would have to undergo anesthesia. General anesthesia
can cause shivering in the body by dropping the body temperature
to a significant extent. So, pre-warming of patients is necessary
before taking them into the surgery room. The cold temperature of
the operating theatre and general anesthesia can cause
hypothermia. It can cause severe medical complications that need
to be prevented with the use of warming blankets and other
systems.
Warming blankets and heat blowers are important medical devices
that come into play to maintain normothermia. These blankets run
with the warming temperature supplied by an electric unit that
keeps the body of the patient warm. During surgical preparations,
these blankets are used over the body of patients to provide them
comfort. Prewarming blankets are used before induction of
anesthesia to prevent a drop in body temperature. Hence, patients
can get surgery without complications. If the temperature is not
maintained with normothermia, it can lead to post-surgical
complications. This could increase the risk of infection, cause a
delay in recovery, and prolonged hospitalization.</p>
<h1>How to get normothermia equipment?</h1>
<p> The appropriate use of warming devices such as patient forced air
warming blankets can prevent hypothermia. These devices are
used for normothermia and are available at Wallabies Warm
Care. We are the certified suppliers of this equipment in Ontario,
Canada. Therefore, you can get them as per requirement by simply
placing an online order. We have top-quality warming blankets and
blower units that are ready to deliver at your particular medical
facility. These devices are easier to use and offer subtle use for
maintaining optimal patient health.</p>
