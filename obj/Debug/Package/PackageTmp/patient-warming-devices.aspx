                    <p>Are you thinking of buying patient warming devices for your
healthcare facility? Wallabies Warm Care has covered you up
with a varied range of these devices to be used in hospitals. You
can consider blankets and blowers which play pivotal roles in
helping healthcare providers to manage patients&#39; body
temperatures. Most patients admitted to hospitals for surgeries pass
through mental and physical trauma. They often get affected by the
common problem of hypothermia which causes certain drops in the
body’s temperature. No matter! A warming device you will choose
for your facility would certainly help to prevent hypothermia.</p>
<h1>Warming blankets</h1>
<p>A warming blanket is used significantly in hospitals and critical
care facilities. It is a standardized feature of most healthcare
facilities to render safe warming to the patients. The warming
blankets use warming coils to heat the patient’s body. The
warming blankets pump hot air into the tubes with the help of an
external heating unit. Our warming blankets are light-weighted and
easy to use for the prevention of hypothermia. These blankets have
metallic foil surface which reflects the heat. While these
specialized medical devices are similar to regular blankets. So,
they are expedient to hygienic and store.</p>

		<h1>Air-warming blowers</h1>
<p>
There are many critical situations where keeping the patients warm
is necessary. In hospitals, the most critical condition occurs when a
patient is being prepared for a surgical procedure. The dose of
anesthesia can significantly cause a drop in the body temperature
of the patient. Hence, the use of regular blankets may not be
sufficient to keep the patient warm. Therefore, we are offering air-
warming blowers as high-end patient warming devices. These
electric units are faster to circulate warm air inside the room and
are laced with modern temperature control and monitoring
features. Their work is silent and is light in weight to use
conveniently.</p>
