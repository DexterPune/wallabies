                    <p class =" text-justify ">Medical device manufacturers depend on cleanrooms to ensure that their products are safe to market. A high priority is given to preventing contamination and promoting hygiene when it comes to medical devices. Healthcare providers are assisted in the diagnosis and treatment by these devices, which can improve patients' quality of life. So what's required of a cleanroom to make it safe for medical device manufacture? </p>
						<b>Why medical devices require cleanrooms</b>
						<p class =" text-justify ">For any business that requires a space free from contamination or spoilage of products, a Cleanroom is crucial. By air ﬁltration in the Cleanroom, particulates in the production environment are kept to an absolute minimum.This ensures that no medical device has the potential to cause harm to a patient through dangerous bacteria or contaminants picked up during its manufacture. For example, a prosthetic hip that is implanted into a human body could be especially dangerous if it introduces bacteria that became atached from its production.</p>
