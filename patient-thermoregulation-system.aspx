                    	<p class =" text-justify ">The human body maintains a temperature of about 98.6°F (37°C) using various physical processes. These include sweating to lower the body temperature, shivering to raise it if our body temperature falls lower than 35 degree centigrade, We have hypothermia. This condition can lead to cardiac arrest, brain damage, or even death. if our body temperature rises above 104°F (40°C).</p>

						<p class =" text-justify ">Many factors can aﬀect our body's temperature, such as spending time in cold or hot weather.</p>
						<p class =" text-justify "> Our hypothalamus is a section of your brain that controls thermoregulation. When the hypothalamus senses your internal temperature becoming too low or high, it sends signals to our muscles, organs, glands, and nervous system.</p>
						<p class =" text-justify ">They respond in various ways to help return your temperature to its typical levels.</p>
						<p class =" text-justify ">If our internal temperature drops or rises outside of the typical range, our body will take steps to adjust it. This process is known as thermoregulation.</p>
						<p class =" text-justify ">It can help us to avoid or recover from potentially dangerous conditions like hypothermia or Hyperthermia.</p>
						<p class =" text-justify ">If an individual is unable to regulate their temperature, they could overheat, leading to hyperthermia. If the core temperature falls below a safe level, it will cause hypothermia. Both conditions can potentially be life threatening.</p>
