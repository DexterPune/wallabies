                       <p>One of the common problems which is associated with surgeries is hypothermia. It causes a significant drop in the body temperature of patients before, after, and during surgery. It happens due to prolonged exposure to cold temperatures and anxiety among patients. Well, high-tech inventions in the healthcare sector have enabled medical experts to meet patients’ expectations. Wallabies Warm Care is offering top-quality patient forced air warming blankets to hospitals and nursing homes in Ontario, Canada. These are the warming systems that use a heating unit and blanket for the prevention of hypothermia among patients. These devices are clinically proven to be used for pre and post-operative patient care. </p>
<h1>Working of air warming blankets</h1>
<p>These devices are simple-to-use warming units that enable the hospitals of easy utilization for patients admitted. The device can be connected to a portable heater with a hose. It works to supply warm air surrounding the patient’s body to maintain body temperature. These tech-enabled devices have replaced the use of traditional wire and water circulation heating systems. Also, the use of these blankets provides more control against the inception of hypothermia among patients. </p>

				<h3>Features and Benefits</h3>
<br/>
<h1>Comfortable and safe</h1>
<p>It is needless to cite that pre-operative complications are challenging to tackle. Most complications come across the way of successful surgeries when the temperature of the patient’s body drops to a dangerous level. Thus, this condition can be controlled and well-monitored with the use of patient forced air warming blankets. They provide ultimate warming comfort to patients before, during, and after surgeries. Consequently, doctors tend to operate on the patient with no major complications and it will promote faster recovery for patients too. </p>
<h1>Accurate temperature delivery</h1>
<p>In order to meet the needs of patients and to prevent complications, accurate delivery of warm temperatures is needed. Using these warming blankets can serve the purpose effectively by offering various temperature delivery ranges. These devices can be used to deliver patients at ambient temperature (room temperature). The temperature can also be increased to certain levels such as 32, 38, and 43 degree Celsius. The temperature will also be displayed on the large display to meet all the therapy needs. Also, it will be supplied accurately with the hose-end warm air delivery. </p>
<h1>Compact and silent</h1>
<p>Patient forced air warming blankets are truly awesome when it comes to using them. They are not set with operational complexity and thus can be used easily and are compact in size. They do not cover large workspaces and are also light in weight. So, setting them for use by patients is as smooth as a breeze. Also, the warming unit of these devices is silent so can be placed on a table under the patient bed. Hence, the use of these devices will provide patients with peaceful relaxation during the surgical journey at the hospital. </p>
<h1>Reliable systems</h1>
<p>These devices are reliable warming systems for patients as embedded with safety alarms. These alarms indicate if the temperature goes high or low from the set point. Also, they are useful for a variety of clinical settings.</p>
